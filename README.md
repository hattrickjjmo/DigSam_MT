 Repo specifically created for prototyping and testing a possible OpenAI integrated chatbot for a masters thesis

 The main code is open-source freely available code from https://beebom.com/how-build-own-ai-chatbot-with-chatgpt-api/
 Note: This code is mostly deprecated, and has been revised in this project

 The code does rely on API-key from OpenAI's ChatGPT-4 paid version, although the model used is the gpt-3.5-turbo
 It also seems you need to have a paid account +  pay for API tokens, which is utterly stupid


 The application requires the local machine to have downloaded: 
  - python version at least 3.9
  - packages openai and gradio

These can easily be downloaded by running <pip install -r requirements.txt> in your terminal
